## Why catch-all is hard

Many mailbox providers intentionally accept most recipient checks at SMTP handshake level.  
That means static validators can label risky addresses as valid even when real delivery will bounce later.

## How Reeverify approaches this

Reeverify does not rely on one-shot SMTP responses.  
Instead, we run controlled real-send probing and observe delayed outcomes across a monitoring window.

Key signals include:

- delayed hard and soft bounces
- auto-replies such as out-of-office
- mailbox behavior changes that indicate role transitions

## Practical outcome for outbound teams

With higher-confidence verification before campaign launch, teams can:

- reduce avoidable bounce risk
- protect sender reputation
- focus follow-up effort on contacts more likely to respond

## Recommended workflow

1. Upload risky or catch-all segments first.
2. Wait for the verification cycle to complete.
3. Export verified-safe contacts for sending.
4. Use reply-based signals for smarter follow-up timing.
