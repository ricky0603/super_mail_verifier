## Introduction

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. It's a great tool for building a backend for your app. It's now integrated with ShipFast!

## 1. Create a Supabase account

First, go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create an account. It's free for up to 10,000 rows per table. Then create a new project and a new table. You can use the following SQL schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('users_id_seq'::regclass),
  email text NOT NULL,
  password text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CONSTRAINT users_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## 2. Add your credentials to ShipFast

Copy the `API URL` and `API Key` from your Supabase project settings and add them to your ShipFast project settings. Add these files to your project:

- `.env.local`
- `.env.production`
